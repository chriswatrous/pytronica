To Do:
    Oscillators:
        Square
        Triangle
        Sin
        White Noise
        Quality Saw
        Quality Square
        Quality Triangle
    Synthesizers:
        basic subtractive (standard analog modeling)
        additive
        FM
        something like Absynth
        something like Massive
        that multi-saw synth I made in Reaktor
        study synths in Reaktor and in FL Studio
    Envelopes:
        AR
        ADSR
        arbitrary control signal
    Modifiers:
        Add
        MulAdd
        MemoryDelay
        ProcessDelay
        Convolution
        Reverb (algorithmic)
        Interpolating Delay
        Chorus
        Phlanger
        change name of MulConst to just Mul
        delay with feedback
    Filters:
        1 pole low pass
        1 pole high pass
        2 pole low pass
        2 pole band pass
        2 pole high pass
        maybe biquad, which could be used to create any other type of filter
        parametric EQ
        filters that can take signals as their input parameters
    Combiners:
        AmpMod (multiply signals, total length is length of the shortest signal)
        Layer (adds sounds together at the same time, total length is length of the longest signal)
        Compose (adds soudns together at different times)
        Repeat (repeats a sound at regular intervals)
    Stereo:
        Pan
        a class that takes a mono modifier and makes it stereo
        stereo reverb, chorus, phlanger, synths, etc.
    make sure all object can handle splitting and recombining of the signal paths
    in general all parameters should be able to take signals or constants as inputs
